# My Learning

A collection of code, notes, and small projects created while learning new technologies, courses, and concepts.
This repository is mainly for practice, experimentation, and tracking my progress over time.

## Structure
- **courses/** – Code written while following tutorials or online courses.
- **experiments/** – Small tests, prototypes, or ideas I try out.
- **notes/** – Optional: short summaries or takeaways from what I learn.
- **practices/** – Exercises, challenges, or hands-on tasks done to reinforce concepts and improve problem-solving skills.
